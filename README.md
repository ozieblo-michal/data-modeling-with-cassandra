Project 2: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
==============================================

Udacity Data Engineer Nanodegree project
----------------------------------------

### Project overview
*A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.*

### Project target
1. Create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions.
2. Build ETL Pipeline.

### Project structure explanation
```
event_data folder - all needed data reside
Project_1B_Project_Template.ipynb - the code itself
```

### How to run
Launch Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb to run validation and example queries.
